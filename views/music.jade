      h2 Restless Sunburst
      p(style='margin-bottom: 1em;')
         | Inspired by the following poem,
         em Written in March, while resting on the bridge at the foot of Brother's Water.
         |  by William Wordsworth.
      p.col-md-6
         | THE Cock is crowing,
         br
         | The stream is flowing,
         br
         | The small birds twitter,
         br
         | The lake doth glitter,
         br
         | The green field sleeps in the sun;
         br
         | The oldest and youngest
         br
         | Are at work with the strongest;
         br
         | The cattle are grazing,
         br
         | Their heads never raising;
         br
         | There are forty feeding like one!
      p.col-md-6
         | Like an army defeated,
         br
         | The snow hath retreated,
         br
         | And now doth fare ill
         br
         | On the top of the bare hill;
         br
         | The ploughboy is whooping--anon--anon:
         br
         | There's joy in the mountains;
         br
         | There's life in the fountains;
         br
         | Small clouds are sailing,
         br
         | Blue sky prevailing;
         br
         | The rain is over and gone!

      h2 GarageBand Music
      p
         | As a Mac user, I've fiddled around with the GarageBand application. Using the loops was fun and easy, since I composed all my other compositions using Finale. Below are a couple of the songs I created in GarageBand. Also, find my profile on
