      "description":"For the final project I chose to do some video manipulation. I really like the look acrylic makes when stacked on top of each other, creating another image. I interlaced video clips with stock footage to make a mosaic of interesting images. The main reason for this program was to explore video manipulation. I really enjoyed the bit mashing of the different images and found some really interesting techniques along the way. (Video clips from BBC Motion Gallery)",
