      <p>Patrick has proven himself as a versatile developer that can change technology and gears quickly. We've asked a lot of Patrick and despite sending him in many directions, he keeps up and consistently delivers exactly what is needed. We've asked Patrick to use pipes to bolster our multiprocess test infrastructure, to learn/use Perl to automate our performance guided optimization process, and to create an internal website (using Grails and Google maps) to demo/test our US geocoding engine. In all cases, Patrick thinks carefully about his design and in particular, the user interface. Because Patrick has high standards for his work, he aggressively pursues top-shelf solutions that he is proud to put his name on - a great quality.</p>

      <p>Web development experience beyond his age. Great communication with supervisor. Fantastic follow through with assigned tasks. Energy for topic is obvious when working on all assigned projects. Easy to work with, and others could learn from his internal customer service skills. Patrick learns fast, and would be a great addition to any team. Don't miss this opportunity to hire one of the next best.</p>

      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>In three words, I am passionate, holistic and enthusiastic. I believe in giving every project my all, no matter what it is, and to do so with a positive attitude. As my grandfather used to say, "A job worth doing is a job worth doing well".</p>
      <p>Employed as a Software Engineer with my company, over the last three years I have learned the finer points of Agile Software Methodologies, as well as the complexities of inter-team interactions. I am very lucky to be working on a high-profile modernization project using state-of-the-art technologies, such as Groovy, Jenkins and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
      <p>I have grown by leaps and bounds as a developer since graduating from college two years ago, and possess a strong passion to continue learning. My current position requires a vast array of skills and I enjoy working on our Grails web application, utilizing Bootstrap and PostgreSQL. I possess the ability to work as a full stack developer, from the database to the views, and am interested in enhancing my web technology skills, including Angular, Yeoman, Bower, Grunt, NodeJS, and AWS.</p>
