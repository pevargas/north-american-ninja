      <p>Patrick has proven himself as a versatile developer that can change technology and gears quickly. We've asked a lot of Patrick and despite sending him in many directions, he keeps up and consistently delivers exactly what is needed. We've asked Patrick to use pipes to bolster our multiprocess test infrastructure, to learn/use Perl to automate our performance guided optimization process, and to create an internal website (using Grails and Google maps) to demo/test our US geocoding engine. In all cases, Patrick thinks carefully about his design and in particular, the user interface. Because Patrick has high standards for his work, he aggressively pursues top-shelf solutions that he is proud to put his name on - a great quality.</p>

      <p>Web development experience beyond his age. Great communication with supervisor. Fantastic follow through with assigned tasks. Energy for topic is obvious when working on all assigned projects. Easy to work with, and others could learn from his internal customer service skills. Patrick learns fast, and would be a great addition to any team. Don't miss this opportunity to hire one of the next best.</p>

      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>In three words, I am passionate, holistic and enthusiastic. As my grandfather used to say, "A job worth doing is a job worth doing well". I believe, no matter the project, to give it my all and do so with a positive attitude.</p>
      <p>I'm currently in my third year as a Software Engineer at my current company. This job has greatly taught me the finer points of Agile Software Methodologies, as well as the complexities of inter-team interactions. I am very lucky to be working on a high-profile, modernization project using state-of-the-art technologies, such as Groovy, Jenkins and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
      <p>Graduating from college only two years ago, I have grown by leaps and bounds as a developer and have a strong passion to continue my development. Fortunately, my current position requires a vast array of skills to make the dream work. I find I am most productive and happy working on our Grails web application. Utilizing Bootstrap and PostgreSQL, I have the ability to work on the Full Stack of technologies, from the database to the views.</p>
      <p>I'm most interested in enhancing my web technology skills, including Angular, Yeoman, Bower, Grunt, NodeJS, and AWS.</p>
